https://www.htdp.org/2019-02-24/part_one.html
section 1.2
discusses string append laws, sort of

section 1.3
Try invalid arguments to get type errors
Think about which values this functon works for

1.5
introduces if, what is an expression, evaluation
great how much it just says "have a got to figure out how it works, guess a law, check the docs"
  this is at the core of programming
subtly teaches how to name things by not telling you what to name tall/wide/square
coverage highlighting in IDE teaches about evaluation order

OMG program stepper <3<3<3

ex 27 factor out magic numbers into constants
ex 29, refactor this program in response to a change in requirements

Discusses the differences between batch programs and interactive programs

ex32 - really good!!! What kind of events will future computing systems have to respond to?

Section 3 - HTDP
  Great that it takes a step back after basic expressions and then giving a taste for harder problems
  covers unit testing in a really good and natural way
